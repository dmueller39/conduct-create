# Conduct Creation Docs

Conduct is a platform for daily routines. It enables people to build their own routines from scratch, and use the routines of others. You can create your own daily routines on [Conduct](https://conductapp.net). Examples of different daily routines that have been built are: sleep journaling, optimism building, gratitude building, meditation, brain training, and daily reflections.

This repository contains guides, references, and examples. It is meant to contain everything necessary for you to get the most out of building routines on Conduct. It assumes some familiarity with markdown, as markdown files are the primary mode of creating routines.

You can follow the [first habit](firsthabit.md) guide to get started.

There is a [reference](elementoverview.md) that walks through the different elements.

Finally, there is a folder of [examples](examples).

You can upload your habits on [https://conductapp.net/create](https://conductapp.net/create)
