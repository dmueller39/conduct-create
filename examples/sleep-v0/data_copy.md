Every day for the next N days we will cover a different cause of insufficient sleep. To get us thinking about the quality of our sleep, we'll be answering questions about our sleep behaviors. Every day we'll answer

Day 1: do you have a re

Irregular sleep schedule. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day can improve sleep.
Sleeping environment. The bedroom should be quiet and dark without excessive lights. Blue light from electronics such as TVs, computers, and phones enhances alertness and should be avoided some hours before bedtime5.
Drinking too much caffeine or alcohol. These beverages can interfere with one’s ability to fall asleep or stay asleep.
Drugs. Some prescription drugs, such as diuretics,6 increase the need to go to the bathroom, which can wake users up during the night. Sleep aids, whether over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed by a doctor, can cause daytime sleepiness and other side effects.
Snoring.While some snoring is normal, excessive snoring can affect the sleeper or the partner of the sleeper. This type of snoring may be asymptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)7.
Sleep disorders. Disorders like insomnia can cause difficulty in falling or staying asleep8 and lead to poor sleep quality. Frightening dreams and frequent arousals, which can affect sleep quality, are among the nighttime symptoms of narcolepsy9.
Mental health disorders. Depression and anxiety disorders are common in people who have insomnia. These can lead to racing thoughts at night or the inability to relax and sleep well.

Other factors, such as diet, exercise during the day, travel, and other pains or illnesses can all impact your quality of sleep.

How Long Does It Take You To Fall Asleep?
While the amount of time it takes someone to fall asleep can vary, regularly taking longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep is an indicator of poor sleep on the Insomnia Severity Index.

How Long Are You Asleep in Bed?
People who spend less than 85%10 of their time in bed not sleeping have poor sleep efficiency.

How Often Do You Wake up During Sleep? For How Long?
For quality sleep, it should take less than 20 minutes to fall asleep again.

You should also consider questions about your waking and daytime habits, including:

Do you have difficulty getting up in the morning?
Do you have difficulty staying awake or concentrating during the day?
Do you doze off or find yourself napping frequently?
It is often helpful to keep a sleep diary to answer these questions and take notes of your sleep after you wake up each morning and write down your habits and activities of the day before bedtime. The sleep diary can help you identify factors personally affecting your sleep. You can then make adjustments to your habits if possible or share your observations with your doctor for professional guidance.

1. Your Temperature

Temperature matters. If your body is too warm at night, you’re going to have a hard time completing REM sleep. The optimum room temperature for sleeping is around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (about 18 degrees Celsius), so make sure you check the thermostat before dozing off.

But another thing to keep in mind is your body temperature. Our body operates a process called thermoregulation on a 24-hour circadian cycle that allows it to adjust our core temperature. A lower body temperature at night helps you fall asleep quicker and stay asleep longer.

2. Everyday Concerns

Whether it’s a big report that's due at work, a recent fight with your significant other, or the frustration of having to pay a few hundred bucks to fix an unexpected car problem, the hurdles we run into in every day can significantly affect our sleep.

3. Alcohol

I’m not a big drinker. Still, I certainly understand the appeal of a nice glass of wine to unwind after work or a couple of beers while sitting back and watching the game at night.

At the same time, millions of people turn to alcohol at night as their go-to sleep aid, with around 20% of Americans relying on it to help them fall asleep.

But drinking, especially the closer you get to sleep, will actually do you more harm than good. I’ve talked about alcohol’s negative effect on sleep at length in the past. While it may help you fall asleep quickly, during the second half of the night, your sleep becomes more disrupted.

4. Caffeine

Perhaps the most obvious one on the list. Caffeine, and coffee in particular, is a stimulant. This opens you up to a number of side effects that can hamper your sleep, including:

Restlessness
Stomach cramps
Frequent urination
An elevated heart rate 5) Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is one of the leading causes of interrupted sleep. It affects about 12% of Americans, but about 80% of those suffering from sleep apnea go undiagnosed.

Common sleep apnea symptoms include:

Snoring—which can also be worsened by alcohol use
Excessive daytime fatigue
Trouble concentrating
Memory problems
Mood swings
Headaches
If you’re battling some of those symptoms throughout the night, you should look into getting tested for sleep apnea in the near future.

6. Your Diet

A midnight snack is one of life’s great joys, but don’t go overboard. Higher fat and calorie consumption at night has been shown to make it harder for men and women to reach REM sleep. Avoid big meals right before going to sleep.

7. Anxiety and Depression

Mental health is closely linked to sleep. Anxiety or depression can lead to interruptions in your sleep pattern—making it increasingly difficult to reach REM sleep. Talk to your doctor if you believe you’re suffering from either of these health issues. A game plan to treat your anxiety or depression can help you get better sleep.

8. Exercise

Exercising is great. I would never tell my patients to shy away from a good workout. But depending on your body clock, it might not be the best idea for you to exercise an hour before calling it a night.

The best times to be physically active depend on your chronotype, so you’ll want to have that nailed down before figuring out your gym plan.

9. Your Phone

Harvard researchers have found that blue light—something that comes from our mobile screens—throws the body off kilter. Instead of helping your mind and body wind down, your phone stimulates your brain and makes it tougher to get a good night’s sleep.

Of course, it can be fun to lay in bed and scroll through Instagram or read a quick article before calling it a night. But those minutes on your phone may be costing you sleep later in the night. Try reading a book and limiting your phone time in the hour before you fall asleep. You can also wear blue-light-blocking glasses at least 90 minutes before bedtime.

10. Naps

A 20-minute nap in the afternoon can help us tackle the rest of our day with an extra burst of energy. I know it can be hard to wake up from a little siesta once you’re comfortable, but you don’t want to nap for too long, either. Taking too much of a break during the day can throw your body off and make it that much harder for you to fall asleep at night.

11. Insomnia

If you’re simply struggling to fall asleep at night, you may be dealing with insomnia. Insomnia can be amplified by several of the things we’ve just talked about, including alcohol use, excessive napping, and a poor sleep environment. If insomnia is persistent, you should visit a sleep specialist to determine the cause.

I hope that you’ll be able to look back on these 11 common reasons we have difficulty sleeping and find a solution that works for you.
