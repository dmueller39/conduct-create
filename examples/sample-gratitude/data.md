Daily Exercises

### Description

Improve your feelings of well-being by engaging with gratitude statements every day.

### Full Description

Gratitude has been shown to improve mood, and sense of well-being. This set of exercises is intended to help you adopt and maintain the habit of gratitude. There are over 60 days of different subjects, to eliminate that repetitive feeling of asking “what am I grateful for?”

If you have any doubts, we recommend the free trial before purchasing.

These exercises can be completed in less than two minutes, but the benefits can extend for the whole day. The positive impact on your life can be huge compared to the effort.

“Using this habit to build gratitude on Conduct has been one of the clearest wins since we started. For very little effort, the lift in my feelings of well-being, and interactions with others has been tremendous. I hope others can share the benefits of this simple exercise.” Daniel Mueller, Founder of Conduct

This is not a substitute for consultations with a doctor, and results are not guaranteed.

Welcome to Simple Gratitude, a deck of daily reflections.

Each day, you will be prompted to express gratitude for a different subject.

Your entries will remain private on your device. You can choose to share them with others.

You will fill in two prompts each day. The first prompt introduces the subject. Today's first prompt is on the next page.

A home gives shelter. What are some things that your home does for you?

The next page is a prompt to express gratitude. Don't worry if your gratitude is big or small. It's the habit that is important.
